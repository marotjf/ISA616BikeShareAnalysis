# ISA616BikeShareAnalysis

The following BikeShare Analysis was done for a theoretical company named Downtown BikeSharing. Currently, Downtown BikeSharing is experiencing significant struggles within inventory management and customer memberships/retention. To solve the first problem, I have provided a multiple regression to predict the number of riders per day based on an array of attributes within the data set. In addition, I have developed a regression tree to help the marketing team determine when is best to advertise to casual riders to improve customer rentention and profitability.
